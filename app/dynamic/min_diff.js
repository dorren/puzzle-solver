 *
 * Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2
 * such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
 *
 * If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements,
 * Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of
 * abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5}
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12
 * Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11
